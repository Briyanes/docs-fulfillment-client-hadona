-- Supabase Database Schema
-- 
-- NOTE: This project currently uses static search data and does not require a database.
-- This schema file is reserved for future use if you want to migrate to Supabase.

-- Current implementation uses static data from lib/search-data.ts
-- If you want to use Supabase in the future, you can create tables here.
